# Introducing the Birdboard App
The Birdboard app closely mirrors the [Build a laravel app with tdd](https://laracasts.com/series/build-a-laravel-app-with-tdd) series by [Jeffrey Way](https://laracasts.com/browse/instructors/JeffreyWay), the founder of Laracasts.
## The difference
Some slight difference between this, **Meet Birdboard** and the Laracasts' one is that, the starter kit used on this one is Laravel breeze, for the stack, we have Vuejs and InertiaJs. For the testing framework, we'll be using phppest as opposed to phpunit

## Distinctions
There are minor differences between the Birdboard app and the [Laracasts series](https://laracasts.com/series/build-a-laravel-app-with-tdd). This version utilizes Laravel **Breeze** as its starter kit, while the **stack** comprises **Vue.js** and **Inertia.js**. Additionally, we will employ **PHP PEST** as the testing framework, in contrast to the **PHP Unit framework** used in the original series.
