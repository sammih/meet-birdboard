# Introducing the Birdboard App
The Birdboard app closely mirrors the [Build a laravel app with tdd](https://laracasts.com/series/build-a-laravel-app-with-tdd) series by [Jeffrey Way](https://laracasts.com/browse/instructors/JeffreyWay), the founder of Laracasts.

## Distinctions
There are minor differences between the Birdboard app and the [Laracasts series](https://laracasts.com/series/build-a-laravel-app-with-tdd). This version utilizes Laravel **Breeze** as its starter kit, while the **stack** comprises **Vue.js** and **Inertia.js**. Additionally, we will employ **PHP PEST** as the testing framework, in contrast to the **PHP Unit framework** used in the original series.
